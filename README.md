This is my android 2 assignment. I recieved my save feature process from the first example we did, and got the shell from john with already impl features. 
My custom feature I did from logic base subtracting 255 from the original color, giving the inverse. 
ImpressionView and MainActivity is what you mainly need to see how my code is functional, and ActivityMain.xml is how the bottons are placed.
